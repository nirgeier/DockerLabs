# Lab - Writing Docker multi-stage build

- In this lab we will learn how to write a multi-stage Docker file
- A multistage build allows you to use **multiple images** to build a final product. 
- In a multistage build, you have a **single** Dockerfile which build up multiple images inside it to help build the final image.

## 01. Create the multi-stage docker file

- The first step is to create a Dockerfile.
- Later on we will pass build time arguments to this file to build the desired image
- `Dockerfile`

```Dockerfile
# Get the value of the desired image to build
ARG     BASE_IMG=curl

# Build the base image 
FROM    alpine AS base_image

# Add some content to the 2nd image
FROM    base_image  AS build-curl
RUN     echo -e "This file is from curl image" > image.txt

# Add some content to the 3rd image
FROM    base_image  AS build-bash
RUN     echo -e "This file is from bash image" > image.txt

# Build the desired image
FROM    build-${BASE_IMG}

# We can use the FROM command as we see in the previous line or use the
# We can also use image index instead
# COPY  --from=build-${BASE_IMG} image.txt . to copy a specific content
RUN     cat image.txt
CMD     ["cat", "image.txt"]
```

## 02. Build the desired images

- We will use the following script to build multiple images and to test the results

```bash
#!/bin/bash -x

# Build The curl based image (no-cache)
docker build --build-arg BASE_IMG=curl --no-cache -t curl1 .

# Build The bash based image (no-cache)
docker build --build-arg BASE_IMG=bash --no-cache -t bash1 .

### Build with cache
echo -e ""
echo -e "---------------------------------"
echo -e ""
# Build The curl based image (with cache)
docker build --build-arg BASE_IMG=curl -t curl2 .

# Build The bash based image (with cache)
docker build --build-arg BASE_IMG=bash -t bash2 .
```

## 03. Test the images

- We will now test the 4 images we build perviously

```bash
# Debug mode
set -x

# Test the output images
docker run curl1
docker run curl2
docker run bash1
docker run bash2
```

- You should see output similar to this one:

```bash
+ docker run curl1
This file is from curl image
+ docker run curl2
This file is from curl image
+ docker run bash1
This file is from bash image
+ docker run bash2
This file is from bash image
```

## 04. What will be the results of this docker file?

- Try to answer and then build the following `Dockerfile` to see the results

```dockerfile
# Build the base image
FROM    alpine AS base_image

# Add some packages to the base image
FROM    base_image  AS build-curl
RUN     echo -e "\033[1;33mThis file is from curl image\033[0m" > image.txt

# Add some packages to the base image
FROM    base_image  AS build-bash
RUN     echo -e "\033[1;32mThis file is from bash image\033[0m" > image.txt

#   Build the desired image
FROM    build-curl
COPY    --from=2 image.txt .
RUN cat image.txt
CMD ["cat", "image.txt"]
```

- Test your answer with the following command

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile2 .
```

## 05. Build a specific target

- We can build our specific image and stop at the desired stage
- In other words we don't need to build all the images within the docker file

```bash
docker build --target build-curl -f Dockerfile2 .
```
